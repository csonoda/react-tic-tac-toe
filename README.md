# E39: React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial
In this experience, you will build a GitHub repo containing the code to implement the React Tic Tac Toe Tutorial.

The tutorial indicates that there are two ways to do the tutorial: writing the code in a browser using CodePen, or settings up a local development environment on your machine.

For this experience, you’ll do the latter, but in a slightly different way than suggested, because we’ll take advantage of our knowledge of GitHub and IntelliJ.

Note that to get credit for this experience, you need to commit your code at the completion of each part with the specified message. That will allow the TA to easily “retrace your steps” and see that you worked your way through the tutorial.
